// This file likely contained tests for unofficial features like state machine simulation
// using _mock_ metadata, which are now removed.
// Keeping the file structure but removing the tests.

// use crate::types::TaskState;
// use std::error::Error;
// use std::thread;
// use tokio::time;
// use std::time::Duration;

// Tests removed as they relied on non-standard client methods or mock server features.
