Based on the final plan outlined in bidirectional_server_plan.txt and the code files you've provided, the    
implementation is substantially complete across the three slices, but there are several key integration      
points and placeholder implementations that still need to be addressed to consider it "feature complete"     
according to the plan:                                                                                       

 1 Server Integration (src/server/mod.rs & src/bidirectional_agent/mod.rs):                                  
    • The run_server function in src/server/mod.rs still uses None placeholders when creating TaskService.   
    • The BidirectionalAgent::run function in src/bidirectional_agent/mod.rs needs to be updated to pass its 
      initialized components (task repository, router, executor, client manager, registry, agent_id) to the  
      run_server function (or directly to the TaskService constructor if run_server is modified to accept    
      them).                                                                                                 
 2 TaskService Initialization (src/server/services/task_service.rs):                                         
    • The TaskService::new constructor still accepts Option types for the bidirectional components           
      (task_router, tool_executor, etc.). This should be refactored (likely using #[cfg] attributes on the   
      function signature or different constructors) so that when the relevant features (bidir-local-exec,    
      bidir-delegate) are enabled, these components are required arguments (Arc<...>), not Option<Arc<...>>. 
 3 Background Polling Task Repository Integration (src/bidirectional_agent/client_manager.rs):               
    • The run_delegated_task_poll_loop function currently has placeholder comments indicating it needs access
      to the TaskRepository to find active delegated tasks and update their status.                          
    • The ClientManager needs to be provided with access to the TaskRepository (specifically one implementing
      TaskRepositoryExt) so the polling loop can function correctly. This likely involves adding it as a     
      field to ClientManager and passing it during initialization in BidirectionalAgent::new.                
 4 Task Origin/Relationship Persistence (src/bidirectional_agent/task_flow.rs & result_synthesis.rs):        
    • The TaskFlow::set_task_origin method is a placeholder.                                                 
    • The ResultSynthesizer::get_child_task_ids method is a placeholder.                                     
    • Both TaskFlow and ResultSynthesizer need to be initialized with an Arc<dyn TaskRepositoryExt> (or the  
      concrete Arc<InMemoryTaskRepository>) instead of just Arc<dyn TaskRepository> to ensure the necessary  
      methods for origin and relationship tracking are available and can be called.                          
 5 Tool Implementation (src/bidirectional_agent/tools/):                                                     
    • The plan included example tools (shell_tool.rs, http_tool.rs, ai_tool.rs). While the tools/mod.rs      
      exists, the actual tool implementation files were not created in the provided code changes. These need 
      to be implemented with actual logic for the ToolExecutor to be useful beyond the basic "echo"          
      placeholder.                                                                                           
 6 Advanced Routing & Decomposition Logic (task_router.rs, task_flow.rs, result_synthesis.rs):               
    • The routing logic in TaskRouter::decide is still very basic (hints or default local). The plan         
      mentioned more sophisticated capability matching and policy application, which isn't implemented.      
    • The logic for triggering RoutingDecision::Decompose is a naive placeholder.                            
    • The handling of decomposition in TaskFlow and the actual synthesis logic in ResultSynthesizer are      
      placeholders.                                                                                          
 7 Configuration and Port Binding (src/bidirectional_agent/mod.rs):                                          
    • The BidirectionalAgent::run method currently ignores the port passed to it and the                     
      bidirectional_agent::run function calls it with 0. The server port should likely be determined from the
      loaded BidirectionalAgentConfig.                                                                       
 8 Graceful Shutdown (src/bidirectional_agent/mod.rs):                                                       
    • The run method uses server_handle.abort(). Implementing graceful shutdown for the server and background
      tasks (using the cancellation tokens mentioned in the plan) is needed.                                 

In summary, the core structures, traits, and basic logic for all three slices are in place. However, the     
crucial integration points (connecting the agent components to the server and repository, wiring up          
background tasks) and the more advanced logic (routing, decomposition, synthesis, actual tools) are either   
missing or exist only as placeholders. Addressing these items is necessary to fulfill the complete           
specification described in the plan.
