# A2A Server Testing Framework Plan

## 1. Compliance Testing Objectives

### Core Protocol Compliance
- Schema Validation: Ensure all responses strictly adhere to the A2A JSON schema
- HTTP/JSON-RPC Compliance: Validate proper implementation of JSON-RPC 2.0 specifications
- Status Code Usage: Verify appropriate HTTP status codes for different scenarios

### Feature Coverage Assessment
- **Capability Detection**: Test server's ability to accurately report its capabilities
- **Core Operation Support**: Validate implementation of all required API endpoints
- **Optional Feature Testing**: Test streaming, push notifications, and structured output if supported

### Error Handling & Resilience
- **Error Responses**: Verify correct implementation of JSON-RPC error codes and messages
- **Error Recovery**: Test server recovery after receiving invalid requests
- **Rate Limiting Behavior**: Observe and document rate limiting implementations

## 2. Test Categories

### Schema Compliance Tests
- Validate AgentCard structure and accessibility
- Verify all endpoint responses match schema definitions
- Test JSON serialization/deserialization of all object types

### Endpoint-Specific Tests
For each endpoint (`tasks/send`, `tasks/get`, etc.):
- Valid request processing
- Invalid parameter handling
- Authentication requirements
- Response format validation
- Performance under load

### Multi-turn Conversation Tests
- Track conversation state through multiple interactions
- Test agent memory and context maintenance
- Verify proper state transitions
- Test conversation resumption capabilities

### Streaming Tests (if supported)
- Verify SSE implementation correctness
- Test partial response handling
- Measure streaming latency and throughput
- Test client disconnect and reconnect scenarios

### Push Notification Tests (if supported)
- Validate callback implementation
- Test notification security mechanisms
- Verify notification delivery reliability
- Test configuration updates

### Authentication Tests
- Test all supported authentication schemes
- Verify token refresh mechanisms
- Test unauthorized access attempts
- Validate credential security

## 3. Test Methodologies

### Functional Testing
- **Basic Compliance**: Verify baseline functionality against the protocol spec
- **Boundary Testing**: Test limits of message sizes, number of parts, etc.
- **Negative Testing**: Send invalid requests to test error handling

### Property-Based Testing
- Generate random valid A2A messages to test handler robustness
- Create randomized task sequences and verify correct state transitions
- Use existing proptest framework to create arbitrary message patterns

### Fuzzing
- Content fuzzing: Malformed JSON, oversized payloads, invalid UTF-8
- Protocol fuzzing: Invalid method names, missing required fields
- Security fuzzing: Injection attempts, overflow tests

### Performance Testing
- Measure response times under various loads
- Test concurrent task processing capabilities
- Evaluate memory usage during long conversations
- Benchmark streaming performance

### Interoperability Testing
- Test clients from different language ecosystems
- Verify seamless operation with various client libraries
- Cross-implementation testing with different A2A server implementations

## 4. Testing Infrastructure Components

### Request Generator
- Create valid and invalid requests for all endpoints
- Support for generating all task states and role types
- Template system for quick test case creation
- Library of corner cases and edge cases

### Response Validator
- Schema validation against A2A JSON schema
- Semantic validation of response content
- Error response classifier
- Response timing analyzer

### Task State Manager
- Track expected task states throughout test scenarios
- Verify state transitions match protocol expectations
- Detect inconsistent or invalid state changes

### Conversation Simulator
- Create realistic multi-turn conversation scenarios
- Simulate user behavior patterns
- Generate complex message structures
- Track conversation history and context

### Mock Client Implementation
- Implement full A2A client capabilities
- Support all authentication schemes
- Handle streaming and push notifications
- Provide detailed logging and debugging

## 5. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Compliance Testing

- Develop benchmark suite for performance metrics
- Create interoperability test suite

### Phase 4: Reporting and Analysis
- Design compliance report format
- Implement test result analyzer
- Create visualization for test coverage
- Develop conformance certification process

## 6. Specific Test Cases

2. Task creation with various input types (text, file, data)
3. Task status retrieval (all states)
4. Task cancellation (at different stages)
5. Push notification configuration management
6. Task resubscription and state retrieval

### Error Handling Tests
1. Invalid JSON-RPC requests
2. Missing required parameters
3. Invalid task IDs
4. Unauthorized access attempts
5. Malformed message content
6. Request size limits

### Advanced Feature Tests
1. Multi-part messages with mixed content types
2. Long-running tasks with state transitions
3. Structured output requests with schema validation
4. Streaming with partial response aggregation
5. Authentication token refresh and expiration
6. Concurrent task processing

## 7. Success Criteria

### Compliance Levels
- **Basic Compliance**: Core endpoints work correctly with proper error handling
- **Standard Compliance**: All required features plus basic streaming support
- **Full Compliance**: All features including streaming, push notifications, and structured output

### Performance Benchmarks
- Response time thresholds for various operations
- Streaming throughput minimums
- Concurrent session handling capabilities
- Memory usage constraints

### Security Requirements
- Proper authentication implementation
- Resilience against malformed inputs
- Protection against common injection attacks
- Secure handling of sensitive content

## 8. Implementation Strategy

1. Leverage existing validator module for schema validation
2. Extend the property testing framework for A2A-specific test generation
3. Enhance the mock server to serve as a reference implementation
4. Develop a dedicated test runner for comprehensive test execution
5. Create a reporting dashboard for compliance assessment

This testing framework will provide a comprehensive approach to validating A2A server implementations, ensuring they fully comply with the protocol specifications and offer robust, high-performance agent capabilities.
