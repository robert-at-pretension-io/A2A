# A2A Server Testing Framework Plan

## 1. Compliance Testing Objectives

### Core Protocol Compliance
- Schema Validation: Ensure all responses strictly adhere to the A2A JSON schema
- HTTP/JSON-RPC Compliance: Validate proper implementation of JSON-RPC 2.0 specifications
- Status Code Usage: Verify appropriate HTTP status codes for different scenarios

### Feature Coverage Assessment
- **Capability Detection**: Test server's ability to accurately report its capabilities
- **Core Operation Support**: Validate implementation of all required API endpoints
- **Optional Feature Testing**: Test streaming, push notifications, and structured output if supported

### Error Handling & Resilience
- **Error Responses**: Verify correct implementation of JSON-RPC error codes and messages
- **Error Recovery**: Test server recovery after receiving invalid requests
- **Rate Limiting Behavior**: Observe and document rate limiting implementations

## 2. Test Categories

### Schema Compliance Tests
- Validate AgentCard structure and accessibility
- Verify all endpoint responses match schema definitions
- Test JSON serialization/deserialization of all object types

### Endpoint-Specific Tests
For each endpoint (`tasks/send`, `tasks/get`, etc.):
- Valid request processing
- Invalid parameter handling
- Authentication requirements
- Response format validation
- Performance under load

### Multi-turn Conversation Tests
- Track conversation state through multiple interactions
- Test agent memory and context maintenance
- Verify proper state transitions
- Test conversation resumption capabilities

### Streaming Tests (if supported)
- Verify SSE implementation correctness
- Test partial response handling
- Measure streaming latency and throughput
- Test client disconnect and reconnect scenarios

### Push Notification Tests (if supported)
- Validate callback implementation
- Test notification security mechanisms
- Verify notification delivery reliability
- Test configuration updates

### Authentication Tests
- Test all supported authentication schemes
- Verify token refresh mechanisms
- Test unauthorized access attempts
- Validate credential security

## 3. Test Methodologies

### Functional Testing
- **Basic Compliance**: Verify baseline functionality against the protocol spec
- **Boundary Testing**: Test limits of message sizes, number of parts, etc.
- **Negative Testing**: Send invalid requests to test error handling

### Property-Based Testing
- Generate random valid A2A messages to test handler robustness
- Create randomized task sequences and verify correct state transitions
- Use existing proptest framework to create arbitrary message patterns

### Fuzzing
- Content fuzzing: Malformed JSON, oversized payloads, invalid UTF-8
- Protocol fuzzing: Invalid method names, missing required fields
- Security fuzzing: Injection attempts, overflow tests

### Performance Testing
- Measure response times under various loads
- Test concurrent task processing capabilities
- Evaluate memory usage during long conversations
- Benchmark streaming performance

### Interoperability Testing
- Test clients from different language ecosystems
- Verify seamless operation with various client libraries
- Cross-implementation testing with different A2A server implementations
